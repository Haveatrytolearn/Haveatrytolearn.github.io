    <h1>Maria Alistratova</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Maria Alistratova, and I’m passionate about technology and innovation. I have an overseas legal background, but my experience in legal tech opened the door for me to the world of IT. I’m currently learning web development and programming with She Codes, exploring how to build websites, write clean and efficient code, and create practical tech projects. My goal is to combine my analytical and problem-solving skills from law with new technical knowledge to develop useful, creative, and human-centered digital solutions. Here, I’ll be sharing my projects in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other technologies as I continue to grow in the tech field. 😊</p>
